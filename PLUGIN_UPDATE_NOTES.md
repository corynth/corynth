# Plugin System Update - Production Ready

## Summary

The Corynth plugin system has been completely standardized and is now production-ready with the following architecture:

### Core Changes
- **Built-in Plugin**: Only `shell` plugin is compiled into Corynth
- **Remote Plugins**: All other plugins loaded from GitHub repository
- **Protocol**: JSON stdin/stdout communication (removed gRPC complexity)
- **Auto-caching**: Plugins cached locally in `.corynth/cache/repos/`

### Documentation Updates
- Added `PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system architecture
- Added `PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive development guide
- Updated `README.md` with correct documentation links
- Updated plugin repository's `PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md` with production examples

### Repository Cleanup
- Removed 34 obsolete files including:
  - Old plugin documentation (PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_*.md)
  - Experimental code (plugins-src/, plugins-grpc/)
  - Test files and old binaries
  - Duplicate documentation

### Working System
✅ 14+ plugins available from remote repository
✅ JSON protocol proven reliable
✅ Multi-plugin workflows tested successfully
✅ Auto-installation and caching working
✅ Clean separation of concerns

## Next Steps for Plugin Repository

The following changes should be pushed to the `corynth/plugins` repository:

1. Updated `PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md` with comprehensive guide
2. Ensure all plugins follow JSON protocol standard
3. Update `registry.json` with current plugin metadata

## Testing Completed

- HTTP plugin: Real API calls to httpbin.org ✅
- File plugin: File creation and manipulation ✅
- Calculator plugin: Mathematical operations ✅
- Multi-plugin workflows: Complex dependencies ✅

The plugin system is now **production-ready** and fully documented.
